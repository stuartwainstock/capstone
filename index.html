        <p>My name is Stuart Wainstock and I’m a dad and designer currently based out of Tokyo, JP. As a father, I have found it very difficult to find community and support for the modern father in a non-stereotypical representation. Dr. Warren Farrell and Dr. John Gray describe our current society as having a “boy crisis.” A crisis that is seeing boys fifty percent less likely than girls meet basic proficiency in reading, math, and science. The Representation Project describes the crisis as one that encourages gender stereotypes portraying boys as warriors. Humans that are void of their actual emotions encouraged to demean partners and participate in conflict resolution through violence.</p>

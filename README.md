# Millennial Dad Project Capstone Summary Page

<p>The goal of Millennial Dad is to create a space of self-compassion and resiliency for the modern father. Millennial Dad will do this by reframing what it means to be a father in our society through written, verbal, and visual storytelling as a catalyst for change. With a focus on the redirection of stereotype societal behaviors, addressing the boy crisis, and supporting a community of current and future fathers, caregivers, and parents.<p>

<p>My name is Stuart Wainstock and I’m a dad and designer currently based out of Tokyo, JP, as my wife finishes her second year as an English lecturer at a university. I’ll be writing and creating stores about what it’s like being a dad while living abroad and straddling two countries. I’m hoping to create a space that other fathers, caregivers, and parents can gather tips, reviews, and suggestions for raising a child in a diverse and vast world today.</p>
